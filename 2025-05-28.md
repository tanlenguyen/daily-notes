# ProsperOps
Webdev will be moving workloads from EC2 to Fairgate and ECS.
Cone of uncertainty when it comes to running future workloads.
ProsperOps maintains a monthly cadence while keeping RIs from 3 years out.
Squashing, as EC2 runs down, they lower the purchases and extend the term and lower the commitment, then we can use SP to roll into the work. 
Seeds are convertable RIs that are micro-commitments. RIs can be converted to larger or equal commitments. The seeds are placed until for one year out. We have one commitment planted twice a month, as they expire, they will renew and push down the point.

All of the commitments are on a 3 year term, but they renew over the month. If we were to stop EC2, then the seeds will be left and the RIs would die off, and we would need SPs to cover the rest. The platform can grow commitments over again with the seeds as they are still in the account.

They manage all of the CRIs and move them over to stay or upgrade as we move along.

We do not have long term commitments, they are on a bi-weekly term.
