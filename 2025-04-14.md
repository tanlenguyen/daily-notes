# Secuirty Hub
Findings are still in Security Hub for all regions.

Something changed in Christmas to cause it to change the number of checks. Causing there to be an increase in the number of configs. 

Turning off noise and maybe getting some things to be filtered.

We need to get with AWS Account Reps to see what can be filtered. Help us get the notifications to not be too noisy. Maybe even suppress these. 

Can we set it to set certain *Critical* messages into something else that may be just a *sales* message. 

Can we tag messages from Security Hub. 
## Actionables
- Where it lives once we start supressing.
- Determine what to suppress and how to suppress it.
- Making Sales messages and making in observable
	- Maybe keeping an Excel sheet.
