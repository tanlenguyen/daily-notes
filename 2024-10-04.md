Push tagging!!!
 Tags for:
   Op - untagged and what can be done
   Waste - actual waste of resources
   Look for overlap on these, make two different reports

We need to have tags for more long term goals.

Observe weekly on mark for op and waste.
Self-service dashboard with cloud custodian to allow devs to tag resources.
Filter based on cfn.
PMs and Account Owners would be informed.
Cloud-Custodian repo that has FinOps and CloudOps.
GitHub actions for this so we can just push with k8s. Keep in mind how to manage actions.

Cleanup for resources in C7n, after something is tagged after being marked for Op how to we handle it afterward.

Daily tagging dashboard for ops and waste.
