# ISO 20000
ISO/IEC 20000, often referred to as **ISO 20000,** is the globally recognized standard for IT Service Management, or ITSM. This standard lays out a comprehensive set of requirements and best practices designed to help organization deliver IT services effectively, meeting both business and customer needs.

ISO 20000 is intended to assist organizations in **establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving a Service Management System (SMS).** An SMS is a structured approach for managing and delivering IT services in a manner that is consistent, reliable, and efficient.

Our Executive Leadership Team at TSS has made a strategic decision to pursue ISO 20000 certification. This decision is not merely about compliance; it's also about enhancing our marketability. Achieving this certification:

- Demonstrates our commitment to excellence in IT service management.
- Sets us apart from competitors.
- Enhances our reputation in the market.

Customers and partners see ISO 20000 as a mark of quality, which can unlock new business opportunities and strengthen existing relationships.

Implications of not conforming with SMS requirements include:

- Diminished services.
- Potentially failing an ISO 20000 surveillance audit.
- Being unprepared for recertification every three (3) years.

It is critical that we understand the chain of documentation establishing the direction and guidance for our efforts to attain such a high-level industry certification.
