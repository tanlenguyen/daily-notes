# ISO 20000
ISO/IEC 20000, often referred to as **ISO 20000,** is the globally recognized standard for IT Service Management, or ITSM. This standard lays out a comprehensive set of requirements and best practices designed to help organization deliver IT services effectively, meeting both business and customer needs.

ISO 20000 is intended to assist organizations in **establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving a Service Management System (SMS).** An SMS is a structured approach for managing and delivering IT services in a manner that is consistent, reliable, and efficient.

Our Executive Leadership Team at TSS has made a strategic decision to pursue ISO 20000 certification. This decision is not merely about compliance; it's also about enhancing our marketability. Achieving this certification:

- Demonstrates our commitment to excellence in IT service management.
- Sets us apart from competitors.
- Enhances our reputation in the market.

Customers and partners see ISO 20000 as a mark of quality, which can unlock new business opportunities and strengthen existing relationships.

Implications of not conforming with SMS requirements include:

- Diminished services.
- Potentially failing an ISO 20000 surveillance audit.
- Being unprepared for recertification every three (3) years.

It is critical that we understand the chain of documentation establishing the direction and guidance for our efforts to attain such a high-level industry certification.

- This plan is designed to serve as a practical guide for all stakeholders involved in the delivery of IT services.
- It aims to align IT capabilities with business objectives, ensuring that the technology services provided are both efficient and effective in supporting TSS and customer needs.

ISO/IEC 20000 is divided into two key parts, ensuring a comprehensive approach to service management: 

1. **ISO/IEC 20000-1: Service Management System (SMS) Requirements**  
    This section outlines the essential requirements that an organization must fulfill to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a Service Management System (SMS). It covers all critical areas of service management, including service planning, delivery, and performance evaluation, ensuring that services meet business and customer needs effectively.
    
2. **ISO/IEC 20000-2: Guidance on the Application of Service Management Systems**  
    This part provides detailed guidance and practical advice on how to apply the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1. It serves as a valuable resource for organizations, helping them interpret the standard’s requirements and implement best practices to achieve and maintain compliance.
    
In ISO 20000, a clause is a distinct section or segment of the standard that **outlines specific requirements or guidelines that an organization must** **follow** to comply with the standard. Each clause focuses on a different aspect of the Service Management System, ensuring a comprehensive approach to IT service management. 

Think of a clause as a building block of the standard. Each one addresses a critical component of service management, such as leadership, planning, or operation. By systematically implementing the requirements detailed in each clause, an organization can develop a robust and effective Service Management System that aligns with the best practices established by ISO 20000. 

Understanding and adhering to these clauses is crucial for achieving and maintaining ISO 20000 certification. It ensures that all areas of IT service management are addressed systematically and consistently, leading to improved service quality and customer satisfaction. 

Let’s explore the 10 clauses of ISO 20000 and what they involve.

Clauses 1 through 3 are non-requirement clauses and are meant as informational and foundational elements of the standard.

1. Scope - This defines the scope of the standard and its applicability, setting the boundaries for what the SMS covers within an organization.
2. Narrative - This lists any normative references essential for the application of the standard. Although there are no specific references in this standard, this clause ensures users are aware of related standards and documents.
3. Terms and Definitions - Provides specific terms and definitions that are crucial for understanding the standard. This section helps ensure clarity and consistency in how terms are interpreted and applied throughout the standard.
4. Context of the Organization - This clause emphasizes the importance of understanding the internal and external context of TSS. It requires TSS to identify relevant stakeholders and understand their needs and expectations. It also involves defining the scope of the SMS in relation to TSS’s objectives and strategic direction.
5. Leadership - Leadership is a critical component of ISO 20000. This clause requires top management to demonstrate commitment to the SMS. This includes establishing a service management policy, setting objectives, and ensuring that the necessary resources and support are available. Leadership also involves promoting continual improvement and ensuring that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and communicated.
6. Planning - Effective planning is essential for the success of the SMS. This clause requires TSS to identify risks and opportunities that could impact service delivery. It involves setting service management objectives and developing plans to achieve these objectives. Planning also includes preparing for potential changes that could affect the SMS.
7. Support - This clause focuses on the resources required to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve the SMS. It includes ensuring the availability of competent personnel, adequate infrastructure, and necessary support services. It also covers communication, documentation, and information management to support the SMS.
8. Operation - The operation clause details the requirements for the actual delivery of IT services. It includes managing service delivery processes, relationship processes, and resolution processes to ensure that services meet agreed-upon levels of quality and performance. This clause ensures that TSS can effectively manage and deliver IT services that align with business and customer needs.
9. Performance Evaluation - TSS must monitor, measure, analyze, and evaluate the performance of the SMS. This clause requires conducting internal audits and management reviews to ensure the SMS remains effective and continues to meet TSS’s needs. Performance evaluation helps identify areas for improvement and ensures that the SMS is achieving its intended outcomes.
10. Improvement - Continual improvement is a core principle of ISO 20000. This clause requires TSS to identify opportunities for improvement, implement necessary changes, and ensure that nonconformities are addressed effectively. Improvement activities help TSS enhance its SMS and service delivery over time.
