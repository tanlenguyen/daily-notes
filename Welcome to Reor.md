## Welcome to Reor!

Reor is a private AI personal knowledge management tool. Our philosophy is that AI should be a thought enhancer not a thought replacer: Reor helps you find & connect notes, discover new insights and enhance your reasoning.

Some features you should be aware of:

- **Links:**

  - Reor automatically links your notes to other notes in the Related Notes sidebar.

  - You can view the Related Notes to a particular chunk of text by highlighting it and hitting the button that appears.

  - You can also create inline links by surrounding text with two square brackets (like in Obsidian). [[Like this]]

- **Chat:**

  - Ask your entire set of notes anything you want to know! Reor will automatically give the LLM relevant context.

  - Ask things like “What are my thoughts on philosophy?” or “Summarize my notes on black holes"

  - In settings, you can attach a local LLM or connect to OpenAI models with your API key.

- **AI Flashcards:**

  - Generate flashcards from any note by going to the chat window and hitting the toggle in the bottom right to "Flashcard Ask" mode.

  - Then generate flashcards by running a prompt like "Generate flashcards for this note"

  - Then hit the flashcard icon in the left sidebar to see your flashcards :)

You can import notes from other apps by adding markdown files to your vault directory. Note that Reor will only read markdown files.
