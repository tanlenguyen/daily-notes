When thinking about cost avoidance, rate reduction, and practically every FinOps capability, we must talk again about data and cloud billing. A massive quantity of cloud billing data, likely from a wide variety of vendors, shows up every day. Your ability to ingest, normalize, and then analyze this data into coherent reporting and recommendations is compromised by this complexity and variability. This inefficient process needs a solution.

**FOCUS**Â (FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification) is a project designing a vendor agnostic technical specification for cloud billing data. FOCUS aims to make billing data more consistent and usable across Cloud, SaaS, and even internal billing sources, improving your understanding of your costs, and allowing you to make better decisions.
