## **Intersection of Cloud FinOps & Sustainability** 

Sustainability _in the cloud_ is a critical component of a sustainable cloud strategy and in general is directly aligned with the principles of FinOps. Most simply, it reflects the need to create sustainability as a _nonfunctional requirement_ (NFR) that becomes embedded throughout your IT organization, making sustainability a key consideration alongside other areas, such as accessibility, security, performance, cost, and availability.

In the same way that you have begun to take the cost of the cloud resources you deploy into account as key metrics, you will need to consider the sustainability metrics of those resources more and more. The value of cloud can be measured more fully when considering all the monetary and non-monetary costs. It may not always be possible to make the most sustainable decision when deploying resources in the cloud, but it is important that sustainability becomes a key criteria that is at least considered and that decisions are documented and recorded. 

### Roles and Functional Activities

|FinOps Practitioner|Engineer|Sustainability Practitioner|
|---|---|---|
|- Work with the Cloud Providers to improve the clarity and auditability of their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and factor that data into a usable, consumable format that is relevant for supporting sustainable business decisions<br>- Continue to champion a policy of elastic resource provisioning within the business<br>- Support the business in establishing and measuring ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data, pursuing higher accuracy in auditing the data and aligning efficiency metrics to show positive/negative sustainability impact<br>- Enable the business to make more sustainable cloud workload decisions by providing clear, relevant data that is as near real-time as is practically possible|- Work with Finance and FinOps teams to understand the strategic business guidelines for which cloud options to utilize<br>- Be aware of the sustainability implications of oversizing resource allocations, and work to deploy highly elastic solutions that minimize or eliminate wasted resources.<br>- Be aware of the power consumption metrics of the different cloud services as you incorporate them into the build, and aim to leverage less-demanding options where possible|- Implement Sustainability-focused IT strategies across the organization and beyond just cloud use<br>- Work closely with IT and other stakeholders to reduce emissions associated with IT infrastructure (engineering, product management, third party SaaS vendors etc.)<br>- Promote energy-efficient and resource efficient practices within the IT department<br>- To understand, evaluate, and optimize asset utilization from cradle to grave<br>- Collaborate with the wider ESG team in the organization for reporting and setting targets<br>- Integrate sustainability considerations into procurement decisions|
## **Getting Started**

Being lean won't just have a cost impact, but also, a carbon impact. Many of the same activities you will perform to reduce the cost of your applications will reduce their carbon impact as well. You, as the engineer, can look for ways to reduce emissions by optimizing your workloads for efficiency. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including scaling your resources up or down as needed, using technologies such as serverless computing and containerization to reduce the amount of resources required, and implementing effective resource management practices. By ensuring that your workloads are as efficient as possible, you can help reduce the emissions associated with their operation.

In addition to your own efforts, the FinOps practice and sustainability team at your organization will be looking to partner with you to ensure services are both cost-effective and sustainable. The first step in this process is to assess where you are today and build some sensible time-bound KPIs for optimizing your services based on actual metrics. Below is a list of areas to start when looking to find sustainable, cost-effective optimizations. Note that this list is not exhaustive and there are many additional opportunities that you and your FinOps champion may find.

- Oversized compute instances
- Orphaned instances left running
- Services running on aged, inefficient instances
- Incorrectly sized services
- Compute instances not terminated, or development environments left running
- Excessive retention of storage snapshots
- Data stored on the wrong tier of storage
- Services running in the wrong region/availability zone

## **Making Decisions**

When it comes to sustainability decisions, you'll need to partner with others in your organization to discuss trade-offs and aim for a shared agreement on the balance between cost and sustainability. Aligning the groups will have them working together with engineering teams and avoiding conflict. 

Not all FinOps actions help decrease carbon emissions. Purchasing savings plans or reserved instances to save cost on resources that run consistently in an optimized state, for example, does not impact carbon use but is purely cost-reducing. Use of these commitment discounts to cover oversized or underutilized resources at a lower cost may actually create more carbon over time.

In another example, when comparing regions to operate cloud services, the cost does not always match the sustainability. A region or zone that is highly sustainable due to its power source, may actually cost more due to other operational cost factors. A decision on which region to operate services based purely on the financial impacts could negatively impact your sustainability goals and vice versa.
