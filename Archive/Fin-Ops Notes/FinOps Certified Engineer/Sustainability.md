## Sustainability and Cloud

Over the past couple of years, there has been a large increase in the focus and awareness of sustainability as it relates to cloud consumption, with cloud providers and cloud teams everywhere are talking about measuring and reducing their cloud carbon footprint.

Cloud sustainability is the practice of using cloud computing services in a way that is environmentally and economically sustainable. This involves considerations on the environmental impact of the energy used to power and cool the servers and data centers that make up the cloud, the indirect emissions involved in the lifecycle of datacenter servers, as well as the economic costs associated with maintaining these systems.

- Investors and stakeholders are pushing CEOs and board members to hold them accountable for their overall emissions
- Governments are tightening environmental reporting requirements and regulations
- Customers are increasingly making buying decisions based on ethical grounds, including the sustainability practices of the companies
- Employees are demanding their own companies become more sustainable

Sustainability matters to you, as an engineer, because the carbon equivalent cost of the computers and other resources you will use to build and run your company's IT infrastructure will need to be reported on more than ever before. The widespread use of cloud has allowed for reporting on the sustainability of cloud resources more extensively and in much more detail than was ever possible when computing resources were highly distributed in private data centers and server rooms.

The sheer size of cloud services means a lot of the carbon footprint of compute is now consolidated in fewer places, and among fewer owners. Stakeholders who are more vocal about the carbon footprint of data centers, with a focus on efficiency of hardware as well as the amount of electricity, water and other resources they consume, are focusing on cloud providers more intently as the biggest source of potential data and savings. The use of cloud has also increased the amount of computing resources used overall to feed a seemingly insatiable demand for storage and compute. So, a focus on sustainability is valuable as another mechanism to ensure that we only consume the cloud resources necessary to meet our needs.

## **Cloud Carbon Emissions**

The total carbon emissions that an organization is responsible for are broken down into three categories, known as *scope 1, 2, and 3*. Essentially, scope 1 and 2 are those emissions that are owned or controlled by a company, whereas scope 3 emissions are a consequence of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by it.

- *Scope 1 emissions -* Emissions from sources that an organization owns or controls directly—for example, from burning diesel in on-premises data center generators.

- *Scope 2 emissions -* Emissions that an organization causes indirectly when the energy it purchases and uses is produced. For example, for an on-premises data center, the emissions from the generation of the electricity powering it's own data center would fall into this category.

- *Scope 3 emissions -* Emissions that are not produced by the company itself, and not the result of activities from assets owned or controlled by them, but by those that it’s indirectly responsible for, upstream and downstream emissions from the companies value chain. An example of this is when you buy, use, and dispose of products from suppliers. Scope 3 emissions include all sources not within the scope 1 and 2 boundaries. Scope 3 is where 100% of your cloud provider's emissions are categorized.

Scope 3 emissions are less tangible and are often described as ‘tricky’ to truly get a handle on – as exemplified by any movement from on-premise data centers to cloud services. They make up a surprisingly high percentage of total emissions for many businesses, often the largest portion of the total. When food giant Kraft mapped out the sources of its own emissions, it found that over 90% of total emissions associated with the company were Scope 3 (Greenhouse Gas Protocol). This isn’t atypical; the best estimates place Scope 3 emissions somewhere between 80% and 97% of total emissions for a large business. The FinOps practice and sustainability team at your organization will be looking to measure these scope 3 emissions to identify sustainability opportunities.

It is important to remember, that to an organization using a cloud provider, the provider's emissions are Scope 3. However, to the cloud provider themselves, many of those emissions are Scope 1 or 2. The cloud provider owns and runs the data centers underlying the public cloud services. So, your use of cloud services directly impacts the cloud provider's emissions reporting, in addition to resources they pre-provision to create growth capacity for future use by customers. In this way, the FinOps practice and sustainability teams at your organization, will both be looking for your help, and the cloud provider's help, in determining and reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by finding ways to be more efficient in cloud resource use.

## **Responsibility**

The responsibility for sustainable cloud practices falls in the hands of both the organizations (and engineers) as well as the cloud service providers (CSPs). The service providers are responsible for the impact of the equipment used in a data center, the power sources, and the water usage. You as the engineer are responsible for the designing services to utilize resources and you want to reduce the amount of wasted capacity consumed from the CSP. The more you are consuming, then the more you are contributing to the impact of the data center.
