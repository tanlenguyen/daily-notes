## **Usage Optimization & Rate Optimization**

At a fundamental level, cloud spend is the product of usage and rates (usage x rate = cost). A key objective of FinOps teams is to promote both cost avoidance (related to usage) and cost optimization (related to rates).

FinOps teams will focus on both **usage optimization**, ensuring resources in the cloud are only running when they are being used, and **r****ate optimization**, ensuring we pay the least we need to for the resources that we decide we need to be running at any given time. Using rate and usage optimization in combination allows us to get the best value for our spending in cloud. **As engineers, you play a pivotal role in** **usage optimization by avoiding unnecessary costs through architecting and building systems considering cost as a first class requirement.** When architecting, you can optimize by taking time to find the best architecture fit for your purpose by using the right mix of services to solve the right business problems. Additionally, you can optimize running systems to ensure they are operating efficiently, only running when necessary, scaling appropriately to their workloads at any given time, and cleaning up after themselves by deleting resources as they shut down.

## **Why Do FinOps?**

An excellent benefit of doing FinOps as an engineer is **cost efficiency**. Ultimately, cost is just another metric that you can use to optimize the value of your systems to the company. Cost efficiency awareness demonstrates a level of cloud maturity and individual responsibility and increasingly contributes to the bottom line of the company directly. Further, the accurate awareness of cloud costs and trends tends to improve the relationship with other personas. This leads to an increase in trust and an ability to increase innovation. Building in cost efficiency not only gives you tools to save the company money, it also allows you to free up funds that you can use for innovation, experimentation, automation, etc.

## **FinOps Matters**

Engineers are a key part of delivering business needs through technology. Therefore, it is your responsibility to do so in a way that allows the business to be successful. 

Engineers aiming to build a complete solution need all of the insights and data to understand the implications of the decisions they make. **FinOps matters in the same way security, resiliency, business requirements, and capacity matter.** You need to know all of the parts in order to problem solve and build a complete solution. Complete solutions are built when all parts are considered. 

Pride in engineering means owning your application end to end which includes awareness and decisions that impact cost. By using your money wisely, you enable your future innovation funds to be reinvested. It's all about being well managed.

## **Engineering Motivations**

There is no magic wand to wave and make all teams collaborate and align. However, an important place to start is with empathy for others. If we are able to understand and share the motivations of other teams, then everyone is going to have a better time. This may mean asking a couple questions to better understand a finance partner or taking time to walk a leader through a complex technology term. Additionally, it can be helpful for other teams to know and empathize with the motivations and goals of you as an engineer.
