## The Iron Triangle

Engineering trade-off decisions can be illustrated using what we call the "iron triangle." The iron triangle is not a FinOps specific concept but has been around in engineering for a long time. It illustrates trade-offs you can make between cost, speed, and quality. People often say "Good, fast, or cheap -- Pick two" because it is difficult to optimize for all three elements at the same time in a single system. Just like deciding if you are building a race car or a family sedan, you must decide where on the edges of the iron triangle you will operate to meet the outcomes of the business. You can decide to save money, but that will ultimately involve trade-offs in quality or speed. Similarly, a decision to emphasize quality will likely impact cost or speed.

### Speed
How quickly the team can moves. Speed can be very valuable when you're getting the latest updates or features out to customers, quickly migrating services into the cloud, or cutting time to market for new products.

### Quality
This is the quality of your services. Giving more resources to a service running in the cloud can result in improved availability, disaster readiness, performance, and scalability. 

### Cost
The amount of cloud spend. A focus on cheap will result in lowest cloud costs, but with it comes impact to quality and speed.

## Making Trade-offs

It is inevitable that trade-offs will need to occur when working in cloud. Ideally, trade-offs occur in the following way.

-  
    **Early in the pipeline** - Often trade-offs occur retrospectively after costs come in. In this case, you may have to make decisions based solely on cost. However, making trade-off decisions early in the engineering process will enable greater conversations around all three sides of the iron triangle. If cost is an issue, you may be able to make a trade-off early in the process that preserves quality and cost while knowing speed is going to be lost. 
    
-      
    **Drive value-based decisions** - By using the iron triangle trade-offs early in the pipeline, with each decisions you and your team make, you are able to move in a direction that makes the most sense for the business. The key is to bring quality, speed, and cost into every decision to maximize the value you're getting from the cloud.

## Why It Matters

As an engineer, having these trade-off conversations early and moving in a value maximizing direction allows you the freedom to work within the given guidelines.

For example, knowing the organization is driving toward increased speed, you are able to allocate resources and time accordingly. You can also then have confidence if cost goes up to talk about the trade-offs that were made and the decisions of the organization. 

Additionally, as trade-off discussions become more commonplace at your organization, other personas you work with will come to expect these conversations. For example, if a product owner comes to you and asks for a feature delivery. You and the product owner can then both expect that the conversation around this ask will come with a discussion about trade-offs and the impact on cost, quality, and speed.
