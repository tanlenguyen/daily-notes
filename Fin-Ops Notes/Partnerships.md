## We're All in this Together...

We're all in this together to support efficient outcomes so the business can be successful. The benefit of partnering with other personas across the organization (Finance, Procurement, FinOps, etc.) is that everyone is aligned around how each role will work to move the company forward. This will enable you, the engineer, to know where you're going while having the freedom to decide how to get there. When a team is out of sync with the company expectations, including cloud usage and spend, this can lead to friction down the line. Bringing in alignment and collaboration with FinOps, early in the development process, leads to better engineering and less rework.


## Constraints Can Be Good

**A clear vision for the desired outcome delivered via a clear set of constraints is the goal.** Without constraints, the development process can be too freeform and may not ultimately align the desired outcome with how the business defines value in the cloud. Conversely, too many constraints means there is not enough room for creative engineering to occur, as it leaves no room for innovation. Some of the best solutions to cloud efficiency come by allowing room for engineers to be innovative, with clear constraints but not overly prescriptive guidance for achieving them. Constraints will appear from multiple personas across the organization. FinOps and finance may provide constraints around cost, while security provides input on security constraints. Additionally, you and product leaders can provide guidance on performance and availability constraints. All of these will make the pillars of a well-architected solution.

### **Where do constraints come from?** 

Within a FinOps culture, collaboration is key. The leadership will set the _why_ by setting out strategic goals, finance then sets guardrails in terms of budgets, IT leadership then does forecasts and FinOps teams provide the trusted data, all while leaving the innovation to you. 

  

Incorporating these cost conversations and agreed-upon constraints early in the development process helps to reduce unnecessary waste and the need to clean up future expensive technical—and cost—debt. However, even architecture designed to be cost-efficient at the start can be optimized over time as services change, code and platform efficiencies are created, new cloud services are released and our real-world workload use evolves. 

### **What if you aren't given constraints?**

If your organization has not yet provided constraints around cost, this can be a red flag. Although it may seem exciting to engineer without having to worry about cost, this isn't necessarily a situation in which the best engineering occurs. Guardrails and cost conversations can actually lead to innovative and creative engineering that demands attention from other personas. If no one is telling you what to spend, you should seek what to spend (this way you make the right decision, race car or family sedan).
