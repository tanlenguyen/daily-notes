# Bandit Coalition
Their motto? **“Take what you need, give nothing back.”**

#### **What Do They Want?**

That depends on **who you ask**. Some bandits believe in **redistributing wealth**, helping the humblefolk survive in a world where birdfolk rule from their treetop cities. Others are just in it for **gold, power, and revenge**. But all of them share one thing: **they refuse to bow to Alderheart’s laws**.

#### **Where Do They Operate?**

The Bandit Coalition thrives in the **wildlands** outside Alderheart’s reach. Their hideouts can be found in the dense forests, underground burrows, and even the **Scorched Grove**, where fire and corruption have driven away most settlers. They know the land better than anyone, using hit-and-run tactics to **ambush caravans, disrupt trade routes, and strike at the heart of Alderheart’s economy**.

#### **Who Leads Them?**

There’s no single leader of the Bandit Coalition, but a few infamous names stand out:

- **Grimm Vexspur** – A ruthless Vulpin warlord who believes in taking the fight directly to Alderheart.
- **Mama Jerra** – A wise and cunning Jerbeen matriarch who protects the weak and punishes the greedy.
- **Redfang the Unbroken** – A former Perch Guard Strig who abandoned his post and now leads the fiercest bandit raids.
- **The Hollow Beak** – A masked Corvum who speaks in riddles and deals in secrets, making enemies disappear without a trace.

#### **How Do They Fight?**

The Bandit Coalition isn’t an army—they fight with **stealth, sabotage, and ambush tactics**. They’ll raid supply lines, steal weapons, and disappear before reinforcements arrive. Some groups prefer **diplomacy and smuggling**, while others **burn and pillage** to send a message.

#### **Are They Heroes or Villains?**

That’s up to **you**. Some bandits are **freedom fighters**, resisting an unfair system. Others are **self-serving criminals**, preying on the weak. Will your character **side with the law** to bring them down? Or will you **join them, fighting for a cause (or coin)?** #BanditCoalition
