Five projects
1. Cloud Custodian - c7n has been deployed and there are actions in place
2. Forecasting for account owners
3. License Explorer - Jira updates for a deprecated platform
4. AI - what kind of structure that can be used for the Data Engineering team
5. ECR AWS Registry - letting devs have more access to our ECR registry. Gives them access so long as they have the AWS creds and make it self-service.

Backup policies are in place for disaster recovery. 

Splunk may be integrated into Cisco so we can avoid a cost with it, so we can get the information in XDR.
