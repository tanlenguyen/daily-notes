Dwarven woman is angry at someone and its because there's a bunch of bodies in the sewers. She says if this problem is not solved by the end of the day they'll be coming back here. 

Mr. Abberrant, curator of the museum, he says people are going missing. He thinks it's an infestation of some sorts. He says he fears it might be a mimic or two. He seems a bit too scared to check it himself, or a cursed item. Grist yells out *A mimic?!* Gindrew knows that mimics are creatures capable of shapeshifting, they're usually treasure chests, but that can do anything. He will offer an extra 100 gold per dead mimic. If we find out where they are coming from that's an extra 300 gold. Grist breaks the entry porch with his hammer. Ceilings is 15 feet high. 

We step into the museum. Artemis goes into the kiosk to see if there is anything she can take, she gets some gold. Jindrew looks for a pamphlet showing any new exhibits, he sees one for ancient tools, which is next to the ancient skeleton display. 

Artemis lockpicks into a courtyards, it seems to have a small pool inside of a pond that leads into the well, and there are small copper coins in the pond. Grist jumps into the water. Grist finds a glittering silver ring.

Jindrew goes into the Museum Cafe. Oryn finishes ritual casting Detect Magic. She looks behind the glow, and it looks like an assortment of pie. Pie is bright reddish-pink, still warm, it is impeccable, and crust is crispy. She sees some bottles and hands one at random to Jindrew. Jindrew smells the bottles and a few of them are sweet, Jindrew pockets all the bottles. 

Jindrew and Oryn meet up with Artemis and Grist. Artemis offers Grist that she will keep her items safe. Grist gives Artemis 3 copper pieces. Artemis pickpockets Grist to steal the ring. She puts the ring on, and she gets the sense that it has some magical ability, she will need to attune to it. We investigate and it seems like we have scoured everything here, but there is a ladder. She looks and it's a balcony into a the second floor, nothing seems really amiss, she just sees a hallway up there. 

Artemis goes to the door to see what is going on in the dinosaur exhibit, she opens the door, and we get in. Oryn is inspecting a minotaur skeleton and Grist is investigating the dinosaur skeleton. Suddenly they animate and being attacking us. Jindrew gets a brew that will let him burrow 60 feet, he gets the effects of the Hero's Feast spell, and one that inflicts poison. Oryn gets the killing blow in the minotaur. We have two mimic tongues. 

We proceed further into the museum. Grist hits one of the suits of armor and pings it but nothing seems to happen as we proceed. Grist sees a dagger that is worth at least 3000 gold. We try to break into the armory and we take a cloak. Oryn tells them it is the Cloak of Montebank. We then go into the second section of the armory exhibit, there is more heraldry. Oryn looks around and checks for anymore mimics in this room. Grist talks to Oryn, and asks her more about mimics, but she does not a whole lot and admits that Jindrew knows more about them than she does. 

Artemis goes into the second floor and there is another armory, it is more heraldry and holds some several preserved bodies from far away cultures. Artemis finds armor from Kara'tur. Artemis gets a Katana from one of the statues. Grist goes up to Jindrew to ask him more about mimics. Jindrew tells Grist that they go to where they will get the most victims and they can be solitary or pack hunters, they typically are not territorial. Grist has for the mimic tongue and checks the power of the tongue as it hits the metal.
